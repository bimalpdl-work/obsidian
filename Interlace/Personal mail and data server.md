Creating a self-hosted temporary email service for personal useâ€”where you can generate multiple addresses, store emails until deletion, and keep it privateâ€”can definitely be done, and it's a cool project. Here's a breakdown of what you'll need, and some options for how to go about it:

---

## ðŸ§© Core Requirements

1. **Custom Domain or Subdomain**
    
    - Youâ€™ll need a domain or subdomain like `mail.yourdomain.com` to receive emails.
        
    - Set up MX and SPF/DKIM/DMARC records if necessary (to avoid being flagged as spam or rejected).
        
2. **Mail Server**  
    A mail server to **receive** emails (you don't have to send from these addresses necessarily):
    
    - Lightweight options:
        
        - **Mailu** (Dockerized full mail stack)
            
        - **Mailcow** (more features, Docker-based)
            
        - **Postfix + Dovecot** combo (manual setup, more control)
            
        - **Haraka** (Node.js based, more lightweight and programmable)
            
3. **Mail Storage**
    
    - Use **Maildir**, **mbox**, or just store the messages in a **database (PostgreSQL/SQLite)** or as **JSON files** for simplicity.
        
    - Some stacks like Mailu and Mailcow come with web UIs and APIs.
        
4. **Frontend**
    
    - Web UI (simple inbox view, list of aliases, delete button)
        
        - Build with something minimal: Flask (Python), Express (Node.js), or even static HTML with JavaScript fetching data via API.
            
    - Or go CLI-only if youâ€™re a terminal person.
        
5. **Alias / Mailbox Generation**
    
    - Script to generate random aliases (e.g., `abc123@mail.yourdomain.com`)
        
    - Map aliases to inboxes (e.g., per-user or per-usecase)
        
6. **Daemon to Process Incoming Mail**
    
    - Use **procmail**, **maildrop**, or custom logic via **SMTP hooks** (e.g., with Haraka or Mailin).
        
    - Parse mail with tools like:
        
        - Pythonâ€™s `email` library
            
        - `mailparser` (Python)
            
        - `node-imap` or `mailparser` (Node.js)
            
7. **Storage & Expiry Logic**
    
    - Emails stored until deleted manually (so no auto-expiry unless you implement it)
        
    - Optional: Add expiry timers per alias if needed
        
8. **Security**
    
    - TLS (SSL) with Letâ€™s Encrypt
        
    - Basic Auth or login for the web interface
        
    - Avoid open relaysâ€”donâ€™t let others use your SMTP to send

## ðŸ§° Recommended Stack (Simple Self-Hosted Setup)

### Option 1: Docker-based Mail Stack + Flask UI

- **Mailu** â†’ Handles mail receiving, storing
    
- **PostgreSQL/Redis** (comes with Mailu)
    
- Custom **Flask web app**:
    
    - Dashboard to view inboxes
        
    - Create/delete aliases
        
    - Delete emails manually
        

### Option 2: Build Your Own Light Receiver (DIY Route)

- Use **Haraka** or **SMTP2HTTP**: receive email, POST it to your API
    
- Backend (Flask / Node.js):
    
    - Receives incoming emails as POST
        
    - Saves to JSON / DB
        
    - Renders inbox via web UI

## âœ¨ Nice-to-Haves

- Dark mode UI
    
- Search & filter in inbox
    
- Label/tagging per alias
    
- Push notifications (e.g., via Telegram bot)
    
- CLI tool to create aliases or check mail

## ðŸš€ Final Thoughts

If it's _just for you_, you can get away with:

- Single VPS (e.g., $5 DigitalOcean/Linode)
    
- Docker + Mailu
    
- SQLite or file-based storage
    
- Simple Python/Flask app for inbox UI
    

Would you like me to help you scaffold the code or Docker Compose for one of these setups?
